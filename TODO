comtypes TODO-list
==================

Bugs
----

Events handlers for office applications (Word, Excel) are called with
the arguments in reverse order.

In test_comserver.py, TestLocalServer.test_get_typeinfo() fails with
an access violation.  No idea why.

Features planned
----------------

Improve dynamic dispatch support, based on patches provided by Michael
Curran.  See
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.comtypes.user/199

Provide a .cab file for easy installation on Windows CE.
